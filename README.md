# Tracefolio.xyz website

Vue 3 + Vite prototype for the Tracefolio.xyz collector marketplace, based on `../WHITEPAPER.md`.

## Run locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run the production build with `npm run build`. Run Vue's template type check with `npm run check`.

## Prototype boundaries

- Product cards, prices, condition notes, and passport data are presentation samples. They do not represent live listings, sellers, inventory, or transactions.
- Wallet connection, escrow, NFT issuance, staking, membership passes, governance, and prize draws are not connected to contracts or live services.
- The planned sale lifecycle is: after a sale, the seller records and submits a video showing the physical item being destroyed; a system administrator reviews the video and order; approval mints the Item NFT into escrow, and the Trade Proof NFT is minted after the dispute window. Both credentials are preserved permanently on-chain. This lifecycle is represented in the UI as a design draft and is not enabled.
- Staking weight multipliers, fee rates, epoch lengths, token supply, and allocations are proposed whitepaper parameters. No fixed APY or investment return is promised.
- Tracefolio.xyz is an independent marketplace, not a brand's official store or licensed channel. Item NFTs describe platform records and do not convey brand intellectual property.
